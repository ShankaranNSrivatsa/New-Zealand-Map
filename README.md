# New Zealand Traveler Simulation

This project is a **Java-based map simulation of New Zealand**, where a traveler moves around the map, interacts with landmarks, and avoids moving objects such as cars and boats.  

## Overview
- The map represents **New Zealand** with various **landmarks** marked as yellow dots.  
- As the traveler moves near a landmark, the program displays **information about that landmark**.  
- **Moving objects** (cars, boats, etc.) are present on the map:
  - The traveler can **collide** with these objects, adding a challenge to navigation.  
- The project uses **HashMaps/Hashtables** to efficiently manage and track:
  - Landmarks and their associated information  
  - Traveler movement and current location  
  - Dynamic objects moving on the map  

## Features
- Traveler movement across the entire map  
- Landmark proximity detection with pop-up or console-based info  
- Collision mechanics with moving cars and boats  
- Efficient data handling with HashMaps/Hashtables  
- Interactive, visual simulation
